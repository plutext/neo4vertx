# org.openpcf.neo4vertx 1.3.x

Vert.x module to read and write a Neo4J graph database. Updated to support
the latest version of Vert.x and Neo4J (both 2.1 at the time of writing).

This module is based originally on the work done by Philip Br√ºll to make
Vert.x 1.3 talk to Neo4j 1.9M1 (https://github.com/phifty/vertx-neo4j-graph).


## Features

 * Maven build to automatically create a module with dependencies
 * A Vert.x 2.1 module to talk to an embedded Neo4J 2.1 database
 * Enables Neo4j web interface on embedded instances

## Usage

Deploy neo4vertx within your vert.x application and send a Cypher JSON query request.
Please refer to the [doc/examples/javascript](https://github.com/raaftech/neo4vertx/tree/master/examples/javascript-example) directory for a complete working example. To see how to format your Cypher queries, check the [Cypher REST API](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api-cypher.html).


### Example "basic usage" of neo4vertx:

```
function doQuery(someCallback) {

    // A valid Cypher query string wrapped in JSON.
    var queryJsonObject = { "query": "MATCH (n) RETURN n" };

    // Send eventbus message, have someCallback handle it.
    eventBus.send(
        'neo4j-graph.cypher.query',
        queryJsonObject,
        someCallback
    );
}
```
